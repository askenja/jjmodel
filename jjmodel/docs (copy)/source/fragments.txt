At the moment, we cannot offer an automatic download of the isochrone packages for technical reasons, so you need to download them manually from here: `Padova (Johnson+Gaia_DR1+Gaia_EDR3) <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QkaFTrepG6DKoUmLKU46eILCI7uHRIE2/view?usp=sharing>`_, `MIST (Johnson+2MASS+Gaia_DR1+Gaia_EDR3) <https://drive.google.com/file/d/1REWCW0eAk_iUacSQmds9Wcl-NbF5iH23/view?usp=sharing>`_. 

To find a path to the **jjmodel** library on your computer, you can do in python:

.. code-block:: python 
   
   import os 
   import jjmodel
   os.path.dirname(jjmodel.__file__) 
   
For example, the package directory (``package_directory``) can be ``/home/skevja/anaconda2/envs/py3/lib/python3.8/site-packages/jjmodel``. Open a terminal in the the folder with your downloaded isochrone archive. Assuming that you have chosen Padova multiband isochrones, you need to execute the following command:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   $ unzip multiband.zip -d isochrone_directory
   
where ``isochrone_directory`` is constructed as ``package_directory+/input/isochrones/Padova``. This will produce quite a lot of output in the terminal due to a large number of isochrone tables in the archive. 

If you plan to work with different stellar evolution libraries, you can download all available archives, just remember to give a correct destination in each case (``package_directory+/input/isochrones/Padova`` or ``package_directory+/input/isochrones/MIST``).
