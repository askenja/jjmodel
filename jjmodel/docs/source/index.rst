*************************************

**jjmodel** (Just-Jahrei√ü model) is a Python package for a semi-analytic model of the Milky Way (MW) disk. 
The latest version is designed 
for modeling Galactocentric distances from approximately 4 kpc to 14 kpc and heights up to about 2 kpc. 
This code is complemented by three alternative sets of isochrones (PARSEC, MIST, and BaSTI), 
such that users can synthesize stellar populations and select observable samples on the colour-magnitude diagram.

Check out :doc:`installation` for instructions on how to install the package. Also read section :doc:`acknowledgements` for the list of publications and the way of acknowledging this code. 

.. note::

   This project is *under active development*. 
   
   If you have questions, suggestions, requests, or want to report a bug, 
   please feel free to contact the developers (see :doc:`contacts`).
