Welcome to jjmodel's documentation!
===================================

**jjmodel** (from Just-Jahrei√ü model) is a Python library for a semi-analytic model of the Milky Way (MW) disk. The latest version is designed 
for modelling the MW disk within the Galactocentric distances of approximately 4-14 kpc. 
The code is complemented by a set of `Padova <http://stev.oapd.inaf.it/cgi-bin/cmd>`_ and `MIST <https://waps.cfa.harvard.edu/MIST/>`_ isochrones, 
such that users can synthesise stellar populations and select the observable samples on the colour-magnitude diagram.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including :ref:`installation` on how to install the project.
