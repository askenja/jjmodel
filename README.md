# jjmodel

A semi-analytic Just-Jahrei√ü (JJ) model of the Milky Way disk. The model 
has been recently calibrated against the stellar populations selected from the Gaia DR2 in the Solar neighborhood, and is now generalized for a wide range of Galactocentric distances, approx. 4 kpc < R < 14 kpc (the bulge region is avoided). The generalized JJ model is complemented by three alternative sets of isochrones (PARSEC, MIST, and BaSTI), such that user can synthesize stellar populations and select the observable samples on the colour-magnitude diagram, as well as apply custom cuts on such quantities as ages, metallicities, logg, or effective temperatures. 

The latest model version is presented in Sysoliatina and Just (2022) in prep (link will be added soon). 

An extended documentation on the code installation and usage, as well as more information about the JJ model, can be found
